This assignment will have you expand on your site's capabilities by using relevant frameworks and/or libraries. Make sure to refer to the unit readings for helpful reference material as well as additional resources. 

### Description
Think about where your website is at and where you want it to be:
- Which of the libraries and frameworks we learned about (Node, React, Jekyll) would help provide the kind of functionality you're interested in?
- Which of the libary's or framework's features are you most interested in utilizing?
- What needs aren't met by these libraries and frameworks?

There are tons of libraries and frameworks to help you create the website and web apps of your dreams. If the ones we've covered aren't meeting your site's needs, take some time to explore the additional options below, or do your own research to identify one or more libraries or frameworks that'll make your site easier to implement.

- [anime.js](https://animejs.com): "a lightweight JavaScript animation library"
- [d3.js](https://d3js.org): "the JavaScript library for bespoke data visualization"
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com):"fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js"
- [Express Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars): "a Handlebars view engine for Express which doesn't suck"
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com):"minimal templating on steroids"
- [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/): "for developers to create charts and dashboards for web and mobile platforms"
- [Leaflet Maps](https://leafletjs.com/): "an open-source JavaScript library
for mobile-friendly interactive maps"
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): "a friendly tool for learning to code and make art"
- [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/about/):  "an open source vector graphics scripting framework"
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/fundamentals): "a 3D library that tries to make it as easy as possible to get 3D content on a webpage"
- [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/): "a visualization grammar, a declarative language for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs"

Once you've identified which library/ies and/or framework(s) you want to use:
1. If you're using more than one library and/or framework, make sure they're compatible with each other
1. Review the documentation for your choice(s)
1. Download the software necessary 
1. Complete the setup necessary to integrate or migrate your site
1. Start working on implementing your missing/wanted functionality

### Support Videos
Given the variety of use cases and tools everyone is using, rather than including a single recorded lecture, I'm including a few videos/tutorials below for the three main tools  (Node, React, Jekyll) presented in the readings. Keep in mind you're not required to use all three, or any of the three for that matter. If you decide to use a different library and/or framework, it's up to you to find the necessary tutorials and documentation. That being said, the course staff will be available to support you as best they can in finding resources and debugging your code.
