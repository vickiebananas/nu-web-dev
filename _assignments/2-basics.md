This assignment will have you bring your wireframe to life as you begin programming your first site! Make sure to refer to the unit readings for helpful reference material as well as additional resources.

### Description
Use what you've learned about HTML and CSS to bring your wireframe to life. Since you only have one week, we don't expect your site to be fully finished and perfect. Instead, focus on completing the following main tasks:
1. All 4 pages are present (even if incomplete)
1. Each page has the appropriate metadata including:
	- Language (using the `lang` attribute of `<html>`)
	- Character encoding (using the `charset` attribute of `<meta>`)
	- Title (using `<title>`)
	- Linked stylesheets (using `<link>`)
1. All images include alt text (using the `alt` attribute of `<img>`)
1. All pages have a *consistent* menu or navigation bar
1. All links are functioning
1. Major design elements are present on each page (i.e., each page looks reasonably close to its wireframe)
1. Some styling is present and is mostly placed in an *external* stylesheet 
1. Styling makes appropriate use of classes and IDs, as necessary

> For now DO NOT use any templates or frameworks, we'll get to that soon!

Below is a demo of a completed Unit 2 lab based on the sample wireframe from last week:

Refer to the recorded lecture below for a walkthrough of me programming the sample site as well as the completed code.

Once you've completed your site, record a short video sharing your screen. Start by showing us tehe wireframe you submitted and discussing any design changes you made as you were programming. Then, walk us through your code, tell us what were the greatest challenges as you programmed your site, and then show us your site live. Make sure to show us each page and click through your links to confirm they work. Use the inspect element feature of your browser to show us the alt text for each image on your site.

> <strong>Tips</strong>
>
> - You can use [placeholder images](https://placehold.co) and [placeholder text](https://loremipsum.io) to fill the content of your site. For now, focus on making sure the HTML elements and desired placement are present and you can fill the actual content later.
> - As you program your site, remember to include comments for yourself so you remember what you did and why for future reference (trust me, youâ€™ll thank yourself later)
> - If you're searching for an IDE, below are some recommendations of free and simple text editors:
>	- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (only available for Windows)
>	- [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
>	- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (not available for Chromebook)
>	- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
