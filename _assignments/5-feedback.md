This assignment will have you share your site with your peers to get feedback on your design. 

### Description
While this week we learned about third party services offered by APIs, integrating an API into your site may not make sense. You are welcome to use an API* for your site if you'd like to but are not required to. This week marks the halfway point of the term so we'll be focusing on getting and sharing feedback on our sites!

1. Upload the URL (option 1) or video (option 2) of your site to the Canvas Discussion for Unit 5. 
	- If you have any specific areas you'd like feedback on, please share them.
1. Explore your peersâ€™ websites (or videos) and provide feedback on at least three (3) of them. Consider:
	- What's the purpose of the site? How well is it accomplishing it?
	- How easy to use and intuitive is the site? 
	- What is the site doing well? What are some areas of improvement?
	- How interactive is the site? Do the interactions make sense given its purpose?
	- If you were the target audience, would you revisit the site? Why or why not?

> \*If you decide to use an API for your site or final project, please note that you'll need to be able to run a local server in order to test your site (otherwise, the API calls won't work). The easiest way to do this would be with [Python](https://pythonbasics.org/webserver/) or [VS Code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-guide/how-to-enable-live-server-on-visual-studio-code/) if you already have either installed, or [read MDN's guide to setting up a local testing server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server).

#### Option 1
> If you're using tools or frameworks (e.g., Node, Jekyll, React, etc.) that require you to run a server to test your site locally, please refer to Option 2. Note that using an API will require you to run a server.

Use a free hosting service to get your website onto the internet. The recorded lecture below shows how to use [Infinity Free](http://infinityfree.net) but if you're familiar with other hosting services you're welcome to use that! Another popular means of free hosting is [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for which you can follow along [these written directions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#viewing-your-project-on-the-web) or [review this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5AwNU3Y2es). Note that as a student, you qualify for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which includes tons of benefits, including private repositories! 

In the past, other students have recommended the following options-- please note that course staff may not be as familiar with the options below as we are with InfinityFree and Github Pages, so it may be harder to get help if you choose to go with one of these. Additionally, not all of the options below are free:
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/webapps/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-web-hosting-plans-for-azure-web-sites/)
- [Firebase/Google](https://firebase.google.com)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
- [Hostgator](https://www.hostgator.com/web-hosting1)

#### Option 2
Record a video navigating your site. Make sure to do it at a pace that allows the viewer to experience your site.

### Recorded Lecture
The lecture below provides additional information on uploading a website to [Infinity Free](http://infinityfree.net) which you may find particularly useful for completing your assignment. However, if you feel comfortable with the material already, you may choose to skip watching this lecture.
