layout: post
unit: Final

This assignment is an opportunity for you to demonstrate how much you've learned over the quarter. Make sure to refer to the course readings and resources as needed.

### Description
You have the option to work individually or in groups of up to 4 for your final project. Note that the more people in the group, the higher the expectations for the final product. Broadly, we want your final project to:
- Demonstrate an understanding of good and accessible design
- Demonstrate proficiency with basic web programming (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
- Demonstrate an understanding of modern web development (optimization, responsive design)
- Demonstrate adaptability and willingness to learn (integration of a new framework or technology)

After you've implemented your project, create a README with instructions on everything required to set up and run your site-- remember to include any required downloads. Then, record a short video showcasing your site, justifying your design choices, and explaining your code. Upload your video to GDrive or YouTube, making sure it's viewable to anyone with the link. Include this link in your README.

While the final project is fairly open-ended, we're including some ideas below in case you'd like some inspiration. 

#### Create a website 
Design and implement a website of your choice. You could:
- Make a personal portfolio
- Make a website for a customer (real or imaginary)
	- You could peruse web dev listings on sites like [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com), [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com), [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com), etc. for ideas of what customers are searching for.
- Redesign an existing website that needs improvement
- Make a website on a topic of interest (e.g., music, art, current events)

#### Create a web application or visualization
Design and implement a web-based application of your choice. You could:
- Make a game, tool, or dashboard
- Create an interactice visualization (explore some [award-winning examples](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/news/636-information-is-beautiful-awards-2023-the-winners), some [FlowingData examples](https://flowingdata.com/made-by-flowingdata/), and some [ScrollyTelling examples](https://webflow.com/blog/scrollytelling-guide))
- Create an interactive animated experience (such as [Pablo the Flamingo](https://pablotheflamingo.com/), [Boat Graphic Novel](http://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/), [Koalas to the max](http://www.koalastothemax.com), [I love you like a fat lady loves apples](https://web.archive.org/web/20200202024758/https://www.iloveyoulikeafatladylovesapples.com/))

#### Create an API-centered website
Create an interactive website that demonstrates the capabilities of a third-party API (e.g. Spotify, CTA, Divvy Bikes API, Twitter, Flickr, etc.). Some examples include:
- [Everlysn](https://gitriley.github.io/everlysn/): "a web application that helps users explore music and find new recommendations. It is built off of Spotify's API and it gives users an essentially infinite source of new recommendations."
- [Imginn](https://imginn.com): "Anonymous web instagram viewer"
- [Where2Go](https://alex-engelmann.github.io/Where2Go/): "a site that allows users to quickly find events and weather for the current and next 6 days. It implements a variety of technologies including SASS, Materialize, jQuery, Moment, the Yelp Fusion API, the OpenWeatherMaps API."
- [Weather App](https://kshitizrohilla.github.io/weather-app-using-openweathermap-api/): "The app tells the current temperature and some additional information like Air Quality Index, Real Feel, Humidity, Highest Temperature, Lowest Temperature, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Visibility, Pressure, Sunrise and Sunset."
