This assignment will have you finish your site and upload it to the web. Make sure to refer to the unit readings for helpful reference material as well as additional resources. 

### Description
Finish the framework and/or library integration(s) you started for the previous unit, then host it on the platform of your choice. 
- If your site **does not** require a server to run locally, you should be able to upload it to InfinityFree like we did in Unit 5. 
- If you're using Jekyll, you can host through [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) for free.
- Otherwise, you may use [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services/), or another platform of your choosing. **You are not required or expected to pay for any service** so take advantage of student and free trials.

### Recorded Lecture
The lecture below provides additional information on hosting through Google Cloud using Node which you may find particularly useful for completing your assignment. However, if you feel comfortable with the material already, you may choose to skip watching this lecture. For the lecture below I followed the instructions for [Quickstart: Deploy a Node.js service to Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service), if you're not using Node but want to use Google Cloud, follow [Quickstart: Deploy a service to Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-service-other-languages).
