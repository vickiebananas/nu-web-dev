This assignment will have you finish your site and upload it to the web. Make sure to refer to the unit readings for helpful reference material as well as additional resources. 

### Description
Finish the framework and/or library integration(s) you started for the previous unit, then host it on the platform of your choice. 
- If you've been using Github Pages or InfinityFree so far, I strongly encourage you to check out a different platform as practicing on a more advanced deployment strategy will help develop crucial skills! 
- Similarly, if you've used a specific provider such as AWS, try using a different one such as Azure.
- You may use the free tiers of [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/webapps/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/students/), or another platform of your choosing. **You are not required or expected to pay for any service** so take advantage of student deals and free trials!

> Keep in mind labs are getting 'lighter' to allow you time to work on your final project! Make sure to be making consistent and steady progress on that as well.

### Recorded Lecture
The lecture below provides additional information on hosting through Google Cloud using Node which you may find particularly useful for completing your assignment. However, if you feel comfortable with the material already, you may choose to skip watching this lecture. For the lecture below I followed the instructions for [Quickstart: Deploy a Node.js service to Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service), if you're not using Node but want to use Google Cloud, follow [Quickstart: Deploy a service to Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-service-other-languages).

#### Tips from Video for Google Cloud
- Use your personal email address, not a school/organization one
- Enable billing for your specific project
- Remember to change your port for environment variables
- Try running your app after updating package.json to make sure it works before trying to deploy. If it doesn't run, start by debugging the changes required for a module program

#### General Tips
- Check whether there are student deals or tiers available for your hosting platform, if so, use your student email address
- If you're required to add a credit card, set a calendar reminder for yourself to disable it after the course ends so you don't get charged
	- Note: There **are** options such as Azure's student pack that **do not** require a credit card
- Review the documentation for your hosting service specifically-- they have the most up to date info
- Remember it can take a couple minutes for servers to update so don't expect immediate/live updates like when we're hosting locally
- Use Piazza!!
