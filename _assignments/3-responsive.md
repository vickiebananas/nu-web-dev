This assignment will have you ensure your website is responsive and up to modern standards. Make sure to refer to the unit readings for helpful reference material as well as additional resources. 

### Description
Start by replacing any placeholder images with real (and relevant images)-- keeping in mind what you learned about image optimization. Remember to write a short description of each image for its 'alt' attribute.

Update your site to ensure it is responsive-- you may stick to raw HTML and CSS features, make use of the Bootstrap framework, or use a combination of the two. Test your site on at least 2 browsers by performing the following and ensuring your site responds appropriately **without 'breaking'**:
1. Resize your browser windows across various widths and heights
1. Zoom your browser windows down to 50% and up to 400% 
1. Use your browsers' developer tools to simulate your site across various devices including:
	- at least one desktop/laptop or XL screen
	- at least two tablets or M-L screens
	- at least three mobile devices or XXS-S screens

Finish up any missing styling for your site. As you're choosing colors, make sure your site has enough contrast-- you can use the [WAVE Browser Extension](http://wave.webaim.org/extension/) or [TPGi's Colour Contrast Analyzer](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/).

Beyond being responsive, modern sites must be *accessible*. Perform some basic accessibility testing using your browsers' built-in dev tools (refer to [Unit 2 readings]({{site.baseurl}}/units/unit2/#developer-tools) as needed) and any of our posted [accessibility testing resources]({{site.baseurl}}/accessibility-resources#accessibility-testing).

Create a document and include a screenshot or video link of *each* of the tests you perform across all of your pages, along with a brief caption explaining what test the screenshot is showing and whether you passed it on the first try or whether you had to perform any updates to get your site to work as intended. Then, write 1-2 paragraphs reflecting on the work you performed to make your site responsive and accessible. Your document should include at least 8 screenshots from your responsive testing and at least 5 screenshots from your accessibility testing.
